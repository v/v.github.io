If any of this sounds like your cup of tea, pick up the book and start reading it! 

Otherwise, keep on reading and I'll share what I enjoyed most about this book

### My reasons for loving this book (spoilers!)

**The book made me respect and understand Travis Kalanick**

Before I read the book, I knew of Travis Kalanick from Uber's press stories over the last decade. I thought he was a douche-y, negligent businessperson that got lucky by being in the right place at the right time. I thought that he had no redeeming qualities and that I'd probably do his job better than he could.

Then, I learned that Travis was a math whiz with a degree in Computer Science?! He was more similar to me than I thought, and easier to relate to.

> A precocious child, he picked up his father’s skills with mathematics, impressing others with his ability to speed through arithmetic in his head where other classmates needed pencil and paper.

> Kalanick himself was no slouch on the SAT. He scored a 1580, just twenty points shy of perfect, and whipped through the math portion of the test with plenty of time to spare. Friends remember his savant-like math abilities. “We were driving across town in Los Angeles once, and Kalanick saw a street sign that said we were seventeen miles from where we were going,” recalled Sean Stanton, a friend and former colleague. “He looked down at the speedometer and saw our average speed, and in a few seconds rattled off how long it would take us to get there so we could make it in time for our meeting. I mean, who does that?”

> He and his computer science friends took full advantage of their T1 connection. They battled each other in games like Quake, Doom, and StarCraft. File-sharing parties were common; groups spent hours trading and downloading music, movies, and images, swapping files as if they were baseball cards.

Travis founded two peer to peer file sharing companies before he worked for Uber - Scour and Red Swoosh. He dealt with all kinds of company crises - running out of money, lawsuits from music publishers, co-founder arguments, partnerships and negotiating acquisitions. 

> At one point, when Red Swoosh was running out of money, an employee dipped into the company’s payroll tax withholdings—money a company reserves to pay the IRS the taxes it owes—to fund operations.

> He was later informed by an advisor that the company might be committing tax fraud. This would stick with Kalanick for years; he felt betrayed, put in legal jeopardy by a colleague
    
> That cycle repeated for the next few years at Red Swoosh. Kalanick would run out of money, then secure a last-minute deal with a larger tech company and keep his business alive for another few months. He’d then find a way to parlay that deal into yet another venture investment, bailing out the company for a year or so longer.

I respect people that have gone through the trenches of company building. Real experience like this hardens you.

Before Uber, Travis also spent a great deal of time giving back to young entrepreneurs. He ran a [blog](https://swooshing.wordpress.com/), and advised young startups from his apartment in the Castro District

> For Kalanick, blogging was a way of marketing himself, along with the occasional talk delivered at startup mixers and cocktail parties.

> Kalanick wanted to be a fixer like The Wolf. After buying his hilltop house in the Castro, Kalanick started investing small amounts of money in various startups with the understanding that he’d be available as their own personal fixer, willing to swoop in and solve problems whenever a founder needed his help. Got a problem with an agitated investor? The Wolf can handle it. Don’t know the first thing about hiring new engineers? Just call The Wolf. Maybe you have late-night thoughts on your company’s next move and want to talk it out. Never fear, The Wolf is here.

This is pretty much what I would do if I made it big - write an interesting blog, help young entrepreneurs make it, and earn a nickname like "The Wolf"!.

Travis gave early employees autonomy and responsibility which explains how they grew so quickly. 

> Kalanick trusted his employees with significant power. Each city’s general manager became a quasi-chief executive, given the autonomy to make significant financial decisions. Everyone was responsible for “owning” their position. Empowering his workers, Kalanick believed, was better than trying to micromanage every city.

> After their time at Uber, Kalanick wanted his troops to go off and start their own companies. He saw the very act of founding a company as a virtue unto itself.

**Uber's stories of dirty tactics and ruthless competition are incredible**

When you hear about the way Travis viewed his competitors at Lyft, you would think that they killed his child.

> Graves, Geidt, and especially Kalanick weren’t above playing dirty. They started booking secret meetings with regulators in San Francisco and encouraging them to go after Lyft and Sidecar.

> every race he [Travis] enters, in anything where he’s asked to compete against others, he seeks nothing less than utter domination.

> Kalanick enjoyed the fight. At first he began to needle John Zimmer, Lyft’s co-founder, on Twitter. In playful jabs, he would troll Zimmer by asking about Lyft’s insurance policies, business practices, and other seemingly esoteric shoptalk. Then he would start picking Zimmer and Lyft’s business apart.

> Kalanick didn’t really want to buy Lyft, anyway. He wasn’t into Zimmer. Something about the Lyft president’s personality irked Kalanick. The Uber CEO didn’t want to work alongside Zimmer. He wanted to professionally humiliate him.

> Kalanick took pleasure in hurting Green and Zimmer, and showed them no mercy.

> In just a year, VanderZanden had risen to be Lyft’s chief operating officer, one of the highest positions in the company, before he double-crossed his partners to join Uber in 2014.

Uber hired spies to gather intelligence on Lyft executives and on driver initiatives.

As a long time tech employee, I think a lot about how to help my team / company win, and Uber's actions make my ideas feel like child's play.

> One Lyft executive grew so paranoid about being followed by Uber that he walked out onto his porch, lifted both middle fingers in the air and waved them around, sending a message to the spies he was absolutely sure were watching.

> Another entity, the Strategic Services Group, the SSG for short, employed the most clandestine tactics of the bunch. It was made up of ex-CIA, Secret Service, and FBI operatives, and hired subcontractors on special anonymous contracts with Uber so that their names couldn’t be traced back to the company. This outfit of black-hat spies engaged in a wide range of activities, some of which eventually spun out of Uber’s control.

> Undercover operations could include impersonating Uber drivers to gain access to closed WhatsApp group chats, hoping to gather intelligence on whether drivers were organizing or planning to strike against Uber.

> The budgets for these black ops departments were obfuscated; Kalanick had purview over them. Nevertheless, Kalanick okayed budgets that spun into the tens of millions for surveillance activity, global operations, and information collection [...] Buying intelligence from third-party firms to gain an edge was normal.

**Real people went through serious and tragic events as Uber grew in cities**

Often, as white collar tech employees, we forget that our work affects real people. Some of the stories from Uber drivers, employees and customers are emotional and hard hitting.

> As general manager of Uber’s Milan office, she worked overtime to convince Uber drivers to stay on the road, even as taxi operators would hail Ubers to their location, pull drivers out of their cars, and beat them. And one night when Lucini was returning home from work, she found a sign hung from a power line not far from her apartment. On the sign was Lucini’s home address, and a message calling her a prostitute who provided her “services” to Milan’s transportation chief."

> Taxi cartels in areas like Las Vegas and elsewhere had deep ties to organized crime, which meant serious and sometimes violent retaliation. Cars were stolen. Sometimes taxi owners would assault drivers and set their cars aflame.

> Cabbies were aghast. Doug Schifter, a livery driver from Manhattan, faced financial ruin after the rise of Uber wrecked his income driving for traditional car services. Schifter drove to City Hall in Lower Manhattan on a cold Monday morning in February 2018, put a shotgun to his head, and pulled the trigger. “When the industry started in 1981, I averaged 40–50 hours,” Schifter wrote in a final post to his Facebook page. “I cannot survive any longer with working 120 hours! I am not a Slave and I refuse to be one.”

**Uber faced unfathomable challenges in the international market**

In China, Uber reported unprecendented growth, which was due to ingenious efforts by scammers.

> he [Travis] noted that in just nine months, the number of trips taken in Chengdu and Hangzhou were more than four hundred times the number of trips taken in New York, one of Uber’s largest cities, when those markets were the same age. What Kalanick left out was the fact that in many cities, more than half of those trips were fake, a complete waste of money brought in by investors.

> But in China, drivers and riders colluded to scam Uber out of billions in incentives, divvying the rewards ... drivers seeking a fake ride would ask for “an injection,” a reference to the small, red digital pin that signaled a user’s location inside the Uber app. A “nurse,” or scammer, could respond in kind to give a “shot” to the original poster by creating a new fake account and going on a fake ride with the driver. The two parties would then split the bonus incentive payment from Uber. Repeated over and over across dozens of cities, small driver bonuses mushroomed into millions in squandered cash ... scammer would request rides from his “passenger” phones, and use his “driver” phones to accept those rides. He would then drive around the streets of Chengdu with dozens of phones spread across the front and back seats of his car, racking up fares for each of the “trips” he was completing for his fake customers. 

> Some scammers created giant makeshift circuit boards filled with hundreds of slots to insert SIM cards, the small microchips that allow mobile phones to communicate with a cellular network. Each SIM card in the circuit board acted as a new number that could automatically respond to a verification text for a newly created account, which the scammers then used to rack up more fake rides and bonuses."

Their Chinese competitor planted engineers inside Uber as corporate spies.

> One of DiDi’s preferred tactics was to send new recruits over to Uber to join as engineers. As soon as they were hired they acted as moles, feeding proprietary Uber information back to DiDi and carrying out corporate sabotage on some of Uber’s internal systems.

Local taxi companies hated Uber and initimidated them with violence.

> In Mumbai, local taxi operators muscled up at Uber’s offices and tried to intimidate employees. Violence was not uncommon; in Bangalore, whenever BD took a ride home from work, he refused to let Uber drivers take him directly to his house; he knew competitors might follow him.

> An angry mob of drivers—some who drove for Uber, others employed by taxi organizations all too happy to stoke anger—showed up outside of Uber’s offices in early 2017 with the dead body of the thirty-four-year-old driver, M Kondaiah, dumping the corpse on the company’s front doorstep.

Drivers and passengers went through horrifying tragedies, and these stories hit you hard.

> The man took out a canister, doused his body in gasoline and then brandished a lighter, threatening to set himself ablaze unless Uber raised its rates again.

> Yadav switched off his cell phone, making the two untraceable to police or Uber headquarters. He found a secluded area, parked the car, climbed in the back seat and raped the young woman.

> For six weeks, Uber employees in India even brought their parents and families into hotels with them; taxi officials were beating up Uber employees in the street.

> [In Brazil,] Osvaldo Luis Modolo Filho, a fifty-two-year-old driver, was murdered by a teenage couple who hailed a ride using a fake name and chose to pay in cash. After stabbing Modolo repeatedly with a pair of blue-handled kitchen knives, the couple took off in Modolo’s black SUV, leaving him in the middle of the street.

> At least sixteen drivers were murdered in Brazil before Kalanick’s product team improved identity verification and security in the app.

**The power struggle between the Uber CEO and the board gives a glimpse into high stakes corporate politicking**

I did not realize that the relationships between a CEO and a company's board could be so confrontational, and that people would construct convoluted schemes to oust a leader from a company.

Uber's board was in a constant 

As Uber started to get bad press, Bill Gurley thought that Uber needed to rid itself of its CEO, and he knew that it wouldn't be easy because Travis had given himself supervoting shares.

> It [the Eric Holder report] was hundreds of pages long, a winding, repetitive list of infractions that had occurred across Uber’s hundreds of global offices, including sexual assault and physical violence. After Ryan Graves read the report, he felt he needed to vomit.

> Gurley and Bonderman worried Holder’s recommendations might not have gone far enough, since they stopped short of pushing Kalanick out for good. Some members of the executive leadership team were convinced Huffington had leaned on Holder and Tammy Albarrán, Holder’s partner, to convince them not to recommend Kalanick’s termination in the final report.

Travis Kalanick was aware of the power that he held, and he didn't hesitate to push people around to retain it.

> Whenever Camp, Graves, or anyone else in Kalanick’s orbit began to chafe at his actions, he usually responded with some version of the same placative sentiment: “Do you know how much money I’m going to make you?”

> But when Sacca began attempting to buy up shares of Uber from other early investors—a practice known as “secondary share purchasing”—Kalanick turned on him. The CEO stopped allowing Sacca to attend board meetings as an observer; the two rarely spoke afterwards.

With a syndicate of Uber' VCs, Bill Gurley hatched a plan to force Kalanick to resign.

> And he [Bill Gurley] proposed a plan that would rely on all of them [Uber's VCs] to work together. Gurley knew Kalanick would never step down of his own volition. They had to force his hand. Gurley knew Kalanick, like a rock climber looking for a toehold, would search for any weakness in the syndicate’s attack. With enough time and effort, Kalanick would find one, exploit it, and sink them all. He was a survivor; they needed to box him in. The minute Gurley walked into the hotel room to negotiate a surrender, Travis would tell the six-foot-nine Texan to go fuck himself. They needed a neutral emissary.

> They worked through every possible permutation of what could happen when Cohler and Fenton approached Kalanick. (Would Travis throw a fit? Would he accede immediately? Would he lunge over the table and murder them?) They typed up a dozen different versions of the letter they would deliver to Kalanick, one for each possible scenario of the coming showdown. Lawyers at Paul, Weiss—the venerable white-shoe law firm—vetted each draft.

> An Uber executive recalled that Kalanick said he was “ready to take Uber’s valuation to zero” before he would ever leave the helm.

> Now, as Cohler and Fenton slid his death letter across the table, Kalanick wondered how long they had been plotting his demise. It was the ultimate betrayal. Kalanick was lashing out like a cornered animal. He wouldn’t take it lying down. He wouldn’t accede to their demands. He was going to fight.

Even after Travis agreed to resign, someone on the board leaked the story to the press, and he didn't get to leave Uber with his reputation intact.

> The story hit the web at just after 1:30 a.m. Eastern Time, as a push notification from the New York Times smartphone app was sent out to the home screens of hundreds of thousands of subscribers simultaneously. “Travis Kalanick resigned as chief executive of Uber after investors began revolting over legal and workplace scandals at the company,” it said. [...] Back in Woodside, the members of the syndicate were all in shock. Someone had leaked the entire story to the Times. In the end, all they wanted was Kalanick’s resignation, not his embarrassment. Somehow, in the scrum of the past forty-eight hours, things had gone sideways.

> Seeing the tick-tock of events on page A1, followed by an enormous graphic of Kalanick’s face shattered—like pieces of glass—across the front of the business section, was too much for him to bear. He was livid; the venture capitalists screwed him, like he always suspected they would. They made a fool out of him in front of the entire world.

And when Uber had to hire a replacement CEO, both Travis and the VC firm Benchmark pulled out the stops to get the outcome they wanted.

> She [Meg Whitman] said that an Uber under Meg Whitman meant the end of Travis Kalanick—music to Benchmark’s ears. One of Kalanick’s allies, who knew of Whitman’s hard-line stance against him, planted the leak with the press to smoke Whitman out.

> the firm [Benchmark] filed a lawsuit against Travis Kalanick accusing him of defrauding Uber’s shareholders and breaching his fiduciary duty, a stunning act of open warfare between board members at a high-profile company.

> Gurley’s idea in suing the former CEO was to invalidate Kalanick’s rights to those board seats entirely.

> The votes [for the new CEO] kept coming in deadlocked; neither side would budge. Then, some believe, Cohler made a miscalculation. The Benchmark partner gave the table an ultimatum: If the board voted for Whitman, Benchmark would drop its lawsuit against Kalanick. It read to the room as an ultimatum. This was the price of peace. Instead of following a fair process to determine the best candidate, Benchmark was effectively holding the board hostage to approve the [replacement CEO] candidate of their choice.
